# CompTIA-Security-Plus-Notes


***IMPORTANT NOTICE:

These notes were specifically created for the CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 exam, which was introduced in November 2020 and officially retired on July 31, 2024. Please note that the exam has since been replaced by the SY0-701 version.

While these notes are tailored to the SY0-601 version, much of the foundational content may still be relevant for understanding key concepts. However, you should cross-reference this material with the latest exam objectives and study resources for the SY0-701 version to ensure you're fully prepared.

Use these notes with caution, as they may not cover all updated topics or changes introduced in the new exam.

These notes are intended to support and guide your preparation. May they serve as a helpful resource on your journey toward certification. Best wishes for success as you work toward achieving your goals!
